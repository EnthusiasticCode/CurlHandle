CURLHandle Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURLHandle is compatible with Mac OS X 10.6 and up. It likely could support 10.5 with a little extra work if you're so inclined
For 10.2 compatibility, please see the legacy version 2.0.
For 10.1 compatibility, please see the legacy version 1.9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING THE CURLHANDLE FRAMEWORK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move the appropraite CURLHandle.framework into /Library/Frameworks.  You can then add the framework to your project, and be sure to copy the framework into your application "Frameworks" directory using a copy-files build phase in Project Builder.  This is what CURLHandleTester does, so that it won't require any installation of curl or CURLHandle.framework in order to run.
