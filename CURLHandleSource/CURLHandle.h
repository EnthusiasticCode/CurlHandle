//  Loading respects as many of NSURLRequest's built-in features as possible, including:
//  
//    * An HTTP method of @"HEAD" turns on the CURLOPT_NOBODY option, regardless of protocol (e.g. handy for FTP)
//    * Similarly, @"PUT" turns on the CURLOPT_UPLOAD option (again handy for FTP uploads)
//  
//    * Supply -HTTPBody or -HTTPBodyStream to switch Curl into uploading mode, regardless of protocol
//  
//    * Custom Range: HTTP headers are specially handled to set the CURLOPT_RANGE option, regardless of protocol in use
//      (you should still construct the header as though it were HTTP, e.g. bytes=500-999)
//  
//    * Custom Accept-Encoding: HTTP headers are specially handled to set the CURLOPT_ENCODING option
//
//  Delegate messages are delivered on an arbitrary thread; you should bounce over a specific thread if required for thread safety, or doing any significant work
//
//  Redirects are *not* automatically followed. If you want that behaviour, NSURLConnection is likely a better match for your needs
