CURLHandle is an Objective-C wrapper for the libcurl.

It was originally created by Dan Wood of [Karelia Software](http://karelia.com), way back in the mists of time, when dinosaurs still roamed the earth (ok, sometime around 2001).

It is now mostly maintained by [Mike Abdullah](http://twitter.com/mikeabdullah) (also of Karelia), with guest appearances by [Sam Deane](http://bornsleepy.com/sam).
